## Topics Covered

### Introduction to ABC Notation
<p>ABC Notation is a text-based music notation system.<br>
The layout for a standard piece looks like this:
{% highlight YAML %}
C: Composer Name
ABC | DEF
{% endhighlight %}</p>

### Navigating the Soundcells Website
<p>Soundcells is an online tool that allows us to generate braille music using text written in ABC Notation.<br>
</p>

### Notes and Barlines
<p>A middle C quarter note is notated as an uppercase {% highlight YAML %}C{% endhighlight %}<br>
The subsequent notes in the C major scale are also notated in their uppercase forms: {% highlight YAML %}D E F{% endhighlight %}...<br>
The notes in the next octave up are notated in lowercase, starting with the first C above Middle C: {% highlight YAML %}c d e f{% endhighlight %}...<br><br>
A barline is notated with the {% highlight YAML %}|{% endhighlight %} symbol.<br>
Since we are currently composing in 4/4 time and each note is a quarter note, we write 4 notes between bar lines.<br>
The final bar line is notated as {% highlight YAML %}|]{% endhighlight %}</p>

### New Keyboard Commands
<p>Ctrl+Shift+Space = Play/Pause Audio<br>
Ctrl+Shift+9 = Jump between Braille Notation and Text Editor</p>

## Challenges to Try On Your Own
<p>Create a one-octave scale starting at middle C.<br>
Create a two-octave scale starting at middle C.<br>
Recreate a tune with only quarter notes. Try Mary Had a Little Lamb. (Hint: a quarter note rest is notated as {% highlight YAML %}z{% endhighlight %}</p>
