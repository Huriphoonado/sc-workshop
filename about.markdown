[SoundCells](https://soundcells.herokuapp.com/) is a Music Notation tool for composing with ABC notation, and creating braille and print scores. SoundCells is developed collaboratively by researchers at the [NYU Ability Project](https://wp.nyu.edu/ability/) and staff at [The Filomen M. D'Agostino Greenberg Music School (FMDG Music School)](https://fmdgmusicschool.org).

In this six-week course, students will learn syntax for notating music in ABC and compose original scores.
